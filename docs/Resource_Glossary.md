- [AWS Security Incident Response Guide Downloadable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/aws-security-incident-response-guide.pdf)
This guide presents an overview of the fundamentals of responding to security incidents within a customer’s AWS Cloud environment. It focuses on an overview of cloud security and incident response concepts, and identifies cloud capabilities, services, and mechanisms that are available to customers who are responding to security issues.

This paper is intended for those in technical roles and assumes that you are familiar with the general principles of information security, have a basic understanding of incident response in your current on-premises environments, and have some familiarity with cloud services.
### [AWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/welcome.html)
The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA) is a holistic set of guidelines for deploying the full complement of AWS security services in a multi-account environment. It can be used to help design, implement, and manage AWS security services so that they align with AWS best practices. The recommendations are built around a single-page architecture that includes AWS security services—how they help achieve security objectives, where they can be best deployed and managed in your AWS accounts, and how they interact with other security services. This overall architectural guidance complements detailed, service-specific recommendations such as those found on the [AWS security website](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security/).

## Tools
### [AWS Cost Anomaly Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-ad.html)
AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is an AWS Cost Management feature that uses machine learning to continuously monitor your cost and usage to detect unusual spends. Using AWS Cost Anomaly Detection includes the following benefits:
- Receive alerts individually in aggregated reports. You can receive alerts in an email or an Amazon SNS topic.
- Evaluate your spend patterns using machine learning methods to minimize false positive alerts. For example, you can evaluate weekly or monthly seasonality and organic growth.
- Analyze and determine the root cause of the anomaly, such as account, service, Region, or usage type that is driving the cost increase.
- Configure how you need to evaluate your costs. You can choose whether you want to analyze all of your AWS services independently, or by member accounts, cost allocation tags, or cost categories.
### [Amazon Git Secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets)
Git Secrets can scan merges, commits, and commit messages for secret information (that is, access keys). If Git Secrets detects prohibited regular expressions, it can reject those commits from being posted to public repositories.
### [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/)
Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
### [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/)
Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS. Macie’s alerts, or findings, can be searched and filtered in the AWS Management Console and sent to Amazon EventBridge, formerly called Amazon CloudWatch Events, for easy integration with existing workflow or event management systems, or to be used in combination with AWS services, such as AWS Step Functions to take automated remediation actions.
### [Amazon Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/?aws-security-hub-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&aws-security-hub-blogs.sort-order=desc)
AWS Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your security alerts and security posture across your AWS accounts. With Security Hub, you now have a single place that aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes your security alerts, or findings, from multiple AWS services, such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, AWS Systems Manager, and AWS Firewall Manager, as well as from AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions.
### [Prowler](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler)
Prowler is a command line tool that helps you with AWS security assessment, auditing, hardening and incident response. It follows guidelines of the CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark (49 checks) and has more than 100 additional checks including related to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO-27001, FFIEC, SOC2 and others.
### [Self-Service Security Assessment](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/assess-your-security-posture-identify-remediate-security-gaps-ransomware/)
The Self-Service Security Assessment is deployed using a simple AWS CloudFormation template that includes a dedicated Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) with two subnets, one NAT Gateway, one Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, and one Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. Once deployed, open source projects Prowler and ScoutSuite are downloaded and installed within the Amazon EC2 instance and begin locally scanning AWS accounts using AWS APIs to run more than 256 point-in-time checks. The checks look at current AWS settings across services like AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon EC2, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon Route 53, and Amazon S3 and assesses them against security best practices.
