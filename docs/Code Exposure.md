## Preparation

This playbook references and integrates, where possible, with [Prowler](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler) which is a command line tool that helps you with AWS security assessment, auditing, hardening and incident response.

It follows guidelines of the CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark (49 checks) and has more than 100 additional checks including related to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO-27001, FFIEC, SOC2 and others. 

This tool provides a rapid snapshot of the current state of security within a customer environment. Additionally, [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/?aws-security-hub-blogs.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&aws-security-hub-blogs.sort-order=desc) provides for automated compliance scanning and can [integrate with Prowler](https://github.com/toniblyx/prowler/blob/b0fd6ce60f815d99bb8461bb67c6d91b6607ae63/README.md#security-hub-integration)

### Asset Inventory
Identify all existing resources and have an updated asset inventory list coupled with who owns each resource.  Source code may be stored in one of the following assets:
- (CodeCommit)[https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/] repositories
- (S3)[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/] backed code storage
- (EC2)[https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/] self-hosted code storage mechanisms

#### Identify what data has been exfiltrated from each asset
- CloudWatch and CloudTrail logs stored in S3 can be queried using (Amazon Athena)[https://aws.amazon.com/athena/] to identify undesired actions
- (Amazon GuardDuty)[https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/] may automatically detect anomalous traffic.  This can be accessed with (AWS Security Hub)[https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/] or (Amazon Detective)[https://aws.amazon.com/detective/]
- Application and instance logs stored in S3 can also be queried using Athena.

### Training
- `What training is in place for analysts within the company to become familiar with AWS API (command-line environment), CodeCommit, S3, RDS, and other AWS services?`
>>>
Opportunities here for Threat Detection and incident response include: \
[AWS RE:INFORCE](https://reinforce.awsevents.com/faq/) \
[Self-Service Security Assessment](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/assess-your-security-posture-identify-remediate-security-gaps-ransomware/)
>>>

- `Which roles are able to make changes to services within your account?`
- `Which users have those roles assigned to them? Is least privilege being followed, or do super admin users exist?`
- `Has a security assessment been performed against your environment? Do you have a known baseline to detect "new" or "suspicious" things?`

### Communication Technology
- `What technology is used within the team/company to communicate issues? Is there anything automated?`
>>>
Telephone \
E-mail \
SMS \

### DLP Implementation

Implementing a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution may provide additional detection capabilities and alerts.  A DLP solution may provide greatest value in EC2 environments or evaluating network traffic. DLP solutions can be found in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=dlp).

## Detection

### Logging and S3 Bucket Checks
- Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions: `./prowler -c check21`
- Ensure CloudTrail log file validation is enabled: `./prowler -c check22`
- Ensure S3 bucket access logging is enabled on the CloudTrail S3 bucket: `./prowler -c check26`
- Ensure there are no S3 buckets open to Everyone or Any AWS user: `./prowler -c extra73`
- Identify the resources in your organization and accounts; such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles; that are shared with an external entity: `./prowler -c extra769`
- Find resources exposed to the internet: `./prowler -g group17`

### Logging and CodeCommit Events
- [Monitor AWS CodeCommit events in EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/monitoring-events.html), which delivers a stream of real-time data. These events are the same as those that appear in Amazon CloudWatch Events, which delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources.
- [Create a CloudTrail trail to enable continuous delivery of CodeCommit events to an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/integ-cloudtrail.html). CloudTrail captures all API calls for CodeCommit as events.

### DLP Alerts

Implementing a DLP solution may provide additional detection capabilities and alerts.  Details are available from the DLP solution provider.

## Escalation Procedures
- `Who is monitoring the logs/alerts, receiving them and acting upon each?`
- `Who gets notified when an alert is discovered?`
- `When do public relations and legal get involved in the process?`
- `When would you reach out to AWS Support for help?`

## Analysis
It is highly recommended to export logs to a security incident event management (SIEM) solution (such as Splunk, ELK stack, etc.) to aid in viewing and analyzing a variety of logs for a more complete attack timeline analysis.

### CloudTrail
CloudTrail provides up to 90 days of event logs for all AWS API calls.  This information can be used to identify and track malicious or anomalous actions.  More information is available in the [CloudTrail Log Event Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference.html).

### CloudTrail: Public S3 Bucket
By default, CloudTrail logs API calls that were made in the last 90 days, but not log requests made to objects. You can see bucket-level events on the CloudTrail console. However, you can't view data events (Amazon S3 object-level calls) by default--you must enable object level logging before those events appear in CloudTrail. 

1. Navigate to your [CloudTrail Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)
1. In the left-hand margin select `Event History`
1. In the drop-down change from `Read-Only` to `Event Name`
1. Review CloudTrail logs for the eventnames `GetPublicAccessBlock` and `DeletePublicAccessBlock`

### CloudTrail: Public S3 Object
You can also get CloudTrail logs for object-level Amazon S3 actions. To do this, [enable data events for your S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html) or all buckets in your account. When an object-level action occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates your trail settings. If the event matches the object that you specified in a trail, the event is logged. 

1. Navigate to your [CloudTrail Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)
1. In the left-hand margin select `Event History`
1. In the drop-down change from `Read-Only` to `Event Name`
1. Review CloudTrail logs for the eventnames `GetObjectAcl` and `PutObjectAcl`

### VPC Flow Logs
VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This can be useful for IP addresses discovered within CloudTrail to determine the types of external connections to any public resources. 

For further information and steps, including querying with Athena, please refer to the [AWS Documentation for VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs-athena.html). It is recommended that Athena analysis be included in a separate playbook and linked to other relevant items. 

### DNS Logs
DNS Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the DNS traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. This can be useful in identifying anomalies or high-risk domains.

### CloudWatch
Data from EC2 instances and other sources may be [ingested into CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html).  This data may be used to trigger alarms or perform analysis.  CloudWatch also provides for [anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Anomaly_Detection.html) where enabled.

### Endpoint / Host Based
1. Navigate to your [CloudTrail Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)
1. In the left-hand margin select `Event History`
1. In the drop-down change from `Read-Only` to `Event Name`
1. Review CloudTrail for `PutObject` and  `DeleteObject` requests from public IP addresses

- Review EC2 operating system and application logs for inappropriate logins, installation of unknown software, or the presence of unrecognized files. 

- It is highly recommended to have a third-party host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) solution (such as OSSEC, Tripwire, Wazuh, [Amazon Inspector](https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/), other)

### DLP

DLP solutions may detect and alert as configured.  DLP solutions are available at the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=dlp).

## Containment

### S3 Block Public Access
aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket bucket-name-here --public-access-block-configuration "BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true"

You can also review [Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/block-public-access/) for additional details on blocking public S3 access across your account.

### CodeCommit

Audit access control for all users with the [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) service in conjunction with CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control.html).

Permissions may also be changed or restricted with the [CodeCommit permissions reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-permissions-reference.html).

## Eradication

### S3 Remove Unrecognized / Unauthorized Objects
Remove any unrecognized objects from buckets

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
1. In the Bucket name list, choose the name of the bucket that you want to delete an object from.
1. Choose the name of the object that you want to delete.
1. To delete the current version of the object, choose Latest version, and choose the trash can icon.
1. To delete a previous version of the object, choose Latest version, and choose the trash can icon beside the version that you want to delete.

### AWS CodeCommit

[Audit identities and access to CodeCommit.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/security-iam.html)

### Amazon EC2

Where possible:

1. [Launch a replacement EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-launch-snapshot.html) using [EBS Snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html) or [Amazon Machine Image (AMI) backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) created from the source
1. [Attach an EBS volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-attaching-volume.html) from the terminated instance to the new EC2 instance.

## Recovery
Same procedures as those listed for Eradication

## Preventive Actions

### Authentication Prowler Checks
- Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA)  is enabled:
 `./prowler -c check12`

### S3 Prowler Checks
**Encryption**
- Check if S3 buckets have default encryption (SSE) enabled: `./prowler -c extra734`

**Disaster Recovery**
- Check if S3 buckets have object versioning enabled: `./prowler -c extra763`

### S3 Service Actions
[Prevent Users from Modifying S3 Block Public Access Settings](https://asecure.cloud/a/scp_s3_block_public_access/)

Regularly review bucket access and policies on a monthly basis and utilize [CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/create-cloudtrail-S3-source-console.html) or Security Hub for automated detections

[Using versioning in S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) to mitigate accidental or intentional deletion of top-level objects

[Managing access with ACLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acls.html) to limit unauthorized access to resources on a bucket and object level

### Amazon EC2

[Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/)

Use TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Some services have this enabled by default, others will need to be implemented (for example in the [JavaScript SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-script/v2/developer-guide/enforcing-tls.html)).

[Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/monitor-with-cloudtrail.html)

[Use AWS encryption solutions such as KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSEncryption.html), along with all default security controls within AWS services.

[Enable EBS snapshots](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html)

### AWS CodeCommit

[Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) with each account.](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/)

Use TLS to communicate with AWS resources. We recommend TLS 1.2 or later. Some services have this enabled by default, others will need to be implemented (for example in the [JavaScript SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/enforcing-tls.html)).

[Set up API and user activity logging with AWS CloudTrail.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/integ-cloudtrail.html)

[Use AWS encryption solutions such as KMS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/encryption.html), along with all default security controls within AWS services.

[Use advanced managed security services such as Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/discovering-sensitive-data-in-aws-codecommit-with-aws-lambda-2/), which assists in discovering and securing personal data that is stored in Amazon S3.

### Amazon Macie
[Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) can detect stored credentials, private keys, and other access data by [using managed data identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/macie/latest/user/managed-data-identifiers.html).

### AWS Config
[AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/managed-rules-by-aws-config.html) has multiple automated rules to manage code exposure including [codebuild-project-envvar-awscred-check](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/codebuild-project-envvar-awscred-check.html) to check if credentials are stored in code.

### Overall Security Posture
Execute a [Self-Service Security Assessment](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/assess-your-security-posture-identify-remediate-security-gaps-ransomware/) against the environment to further identify other risks and potentially other public exposure not identified throughout this playbook.

### DLP Implementation

Implementing a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution may provide additional detection capabilities and alerts.  DLP solutions can be found in the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?searchTerms=dlp) and should be configured as prescribed.
