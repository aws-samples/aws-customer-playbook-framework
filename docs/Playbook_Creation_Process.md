## Executive Summary
This playbook outlines the process to create a new playbook/runbook, transition the document from DRAFT to APPROVED, and re-validation requirements using GitLab.  

For more advanced playbook creation, please reference the [AWS Incident Response Playbooks Workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/43742d64-6a5e-45ea-9339-cbb3fb26944e/en-US)

## Guidance

> It is important to maintain our runbooks to dive deep and deliver results quickly to customers. Per Matthew Helmke "Runbooks help us as a part of a wider set of practices, all designed to build reliability. Keeping runbooks up-to-date is a vital part of site reliability engineering."
(<https://www.gremlin.com/blog/ensuring-runbooks-are-up-to-date/>)  

Our team uses Github to manage documentation. Look at [References](../Playbook_Creation_Process.md/#references) to see some abbreviated steps for our process flow. 

## New Playbook/Runbook

### GUI Procedure

* Create an Issue for Process Tracking
* Create a new source branch to work in
* Navigate to the root of your branch
* Select the "Web IDE" button
* To create an item, highlight the left-margin folder and select the dropdown arrow for options
* Select "New File"
    * Note: It may be helpful to copy the content from an existing playbook for formatting
    * Our documents use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

* Ensure follow standard naming convention for our library  
    * Playbooks: `# Playbook: Playbook/Runbook`
    * Tool Guides: `# Tooling: ToolName`
    * This is the only time Header 1 (H1) is used within the document

* Create a link to the associated issue 
    * Example: `Associate Issue: (./issues/1)`

* Once you've completed your document: 
    * Add a link to your document in the issue as a comment
    * Add the label "REVIEW" in the issue
    * Post a message with a link to your issue in the `customer correspondence mmethod` and request review/comment.  

* In order for a Playbook to be approved at least two (2) team members must have reviewed and added their names and a comment in the associated issue  

* Update and implement any recommendations or corrections to the document    

* Once your document has been reviewed and all corrections made, submit your document for the approval process to be finalized.  

* Go into the issue and change the assignee to an approver
    * Go into the issue
    * Add the label SUBMITTED FOR APPROVAL to your issue
    * In the right-hand margin next to "Assignee" select "Edit"
    * Change the assignee to `approver`
    * Send a note to `approver` letting him know the document is ready for final review
    * Following approval, add a link to the document/playbook into the Readme
        * Example: `[Playbook Creation Process](./docs/Playbook_Creation_Process.md)`
    * Submit a Merge Request

* Note: Remember that all steps prior to the merge request MUST be completed within your working branch

* The SLA for this task is 7 calendar days from the time you submit the document.  
    * If no response has been received within the SLA period for approval, escalate by sending a chime note to `user A`, `user B`, `user C`.

### Using GitHub: Create an Issue

We use issues to track ongoing and completed work. Additionally, this assists the team with transitioning through our review and approval process. This also permits comments from reviewers to address anything withing repository objects as part of our documentation bar raiser process. 

* Graphical User Interface: the GUI allows you to interact with GitHub from a web browser to interact with this repository
    1. Navigate to your GitHub repository using your favored web browser
    1. Open an issue by selecting Issues from the top menu
        1. Select "New Issue"
        1. Add a title and description of what you are working on
        1. Assign to yourself (this will allow tracking in later steps)

            * For new documents ensure you select DRAFT
        1. Select "Submit issue"
        1. On the new Issue page, in the right-hand margin Lock issue > Edit > Lock

* Command Line Interface: the CLI allows you to interact with GitHub form the command-line

### Using GitHub: Create a Branch to Work in

We work in individual branches so in progress work does not interfere with what others may be doing in real-time.

* Graphical User Interface: the GUI allows you to interact with [GitHub from a web browser to interact with this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)

* Command Line Interface: the CLI allows you to interact with GitHub form the command-line

### Using GitHub: Create a Merge Request

Merge Request(s) allow a secondary bar raiser review prior to merging with the parent repository.

* [Graphical User Interface](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges)
